# FrontEnd---Final-year-project
FrontEnd project using Angular(typescript), Ionic, Capacitor.
It has 3 use cases:
Employer use case (such as small employment agencies):
- add new users (admin, client, employee)
- Change details of users
- Delete users
- Add working schedules for employees
- check scan reports of employees (clock-in and out)
- upon creating a new user, the person receives the confirmation with the login credentials on the email that was used to create the account.

Employee use case (temp workers  - agency workers)
- ability to check own working schedules by week (added by employer)
- ability to see scan reports
- ability to clock-in and out using a QR code


Client use case (clients using the agency temp workers).
- Ability to scan the employees's QRCodes for clocking in and out => generating data for scan reports
- Ability to see scan reports

The project is far from finished. Further development will follow.
